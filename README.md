# Notes on AngularJS
This is a notebook based on my personal experience on learning **AngularJS**.

I have to say, that learning AngularJS is quite difficult for me, so I have to collected all the information that I could find to enhance my understanding of Angular.

So I will notes on what I think is necessary to digest Angular. And I will use **ng** to reference to **Angular**.

If you want to read this easily, you could refer to GitBook, or just clone it and access index.html in the _book directory.
